            <p> We started the trip through Lima, the capital of Peru. 
                It was there where I ate the best ceviche of my life! </p>

            <h3 class="subtitle">3. Cusco - Peru </h3>
            <p> The third place was Cusco, the city is beautiful. 
                There the high altitude brought a bit of a headache, 
                and that was when I chewed coca leaves for the first time.
                It is very bitter!  </p>

            <p> Then we went to the magical Machu Picchu! What a beautiful place,
                good energy, and amazing view of the mountains! I LOVED! 
                In addition to visiting the ruins, we ventured up the Montaña Machu Picchu.

            <h3 class="subtitle">5. Ilhas Flutantes de Uros - Puno - Peru </h3>
            <p> Last but not least we went to Puno, there we visit the Ilhas Flutantes de Uros,
                these islands are on Lake Titicaca. 
                Its artificial islands are made with a species of native vegetation, 
                each island belongs to a family. We were able to enter in the islands,
                visit the residents' house, which is also made with this same vegetation, 
                and we learned how everything works.</p>
